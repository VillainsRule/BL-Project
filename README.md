  <h1>the BL Project</h1>
  <h3>the trojan website trolling blooket players everywhere.</h3>

  <h2>what IS this?</h2>
</div>

so, i used to be in minesraft2's, the former blooket hackers', server.<br>
there were a lot of (probably) underage kids asking for blooket hacks.<br>
i made this to teach them a lesson they wouldn't forget. minesraft didn't like it.<br>
eventually he added it to automod then got dmcaed and this project came to a close.<br>
<br>
however, i remembered it and decided to revive it. i took some of the old code & recreated / improved it, and wrote new stuff.<br>
it's up now once more at [bl.villainsrule.xyz](https://bl.villainsrule.xyz)!<br>
